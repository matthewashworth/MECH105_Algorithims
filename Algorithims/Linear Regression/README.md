# Linear Regression
Will preform a linear regression on data set. Will also remove any values outside of the inner quartile range (removes outliers from data set)
## Inputs 
x- a vector with all the x values for the data points\
y- a vector with all the y values for the data points\
Note: x and y must contain the same number of values
## Outputs
fX- the filtered x values (once outliers are removed)\
fY- the filtered y values (once outliers are removed)\
slope- the slope of the regression line in form y=mx+b\
intercept- the intercept of the regression line\
Rsquared- the R^2 value for the regression line (how well the line represents the data)
