# MECH105_Algorithims
All Algorithms Created During Mech 105 Spring 2022 
## Matrices
Creates a m x n matrix where the value of in the first collum or row are the repected collum or row. The other values are the sum of the row above and collum to the left. 
## Root Finding
This Function uses the false position itteritive method to estimate a root of a given function. 
## LU Decomposition
Preforms Gaussian elimintaion on an imput matrix. Will provide the resulting upper triangular matrix, the resulting pivioting matrix, and the resulting lower triangular matrix.
## Simpsons 1/3
Preforms Simpsons 1/3 rule to estimate an intergral of imputed y values and their evenly spaced correspoining x values. Will also preform trapizodal rule on remaining intervals that can not have Simpsons 1/3 rule applyied. 
## Linear Regression
Will take data points, revome outliers not within the inner quartile range and preform a linear regression. Will output the regression slope, the regression intercept and the coresponding R^2 value of the regression line.
